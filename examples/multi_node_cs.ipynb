    "# Distributed Compressed Sensing (Multi-Machine Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **multi-machine distributed compressed sensing** experiment deployed on multiple devices (including Raspberry Pi nodes).  \n",
    "Its main purpose is to evaluate the **runtime impact of communication quantization** in a resource-constrained distributed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the following centralized objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\;\n",
    "\\frac{1}{16}\\sum_{i=1}^{16}\\left(C_i \\Psi x - y_i\\right)^2\n",
    "+ \\lambda \\|x\\|_1 .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $C_i$ denotes the local measurement matrix of node $i$ (randomly selected rows of the identity matrix),  \n",
    "$\\Psi$ is the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis, and $y_i$ is the corresponding observation vector.  \n",
    "The centralized optimal solution is denoted by $x^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference from the Single-Machine Multi-Process Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-machine multi-process version is provided in the same directory.  \n",
    "While that notebook focuses on algorithm behavior and visualization, this notebook targets a **real multi-device distributed setting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this notebook is designed to evaluate system-level performance under limited hardware and network capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to compare the execution time of\n",
    "\n",
    "- **unquantized communication ($\\texttt{float64}$)**, and\n",
    "- **quantized communication ($\\texttt{float64} \\rightarrow \\texttt{int16}$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "during distributed optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is that Raspberry Pi nodes have limited computation and communication capacity, and reducing the communication payload may significantly reduce the overall runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the total runtime manageable in a real multi-device environment, this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- focuses only on timing comparison between quantized and unquantized communication,\n",
    "- omits extensive visualization and convergence plots used in the single-machine notebook,\n",
    "- runs the algorithm for **500 iterations** as a practical trade-off between runtime and comparability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook therefore emphasizes **wall-clock performance of different communication schemes**, rather than detailed convergence analysis."
